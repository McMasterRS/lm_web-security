# Conclusion

Throughout this learning module, we learned the basics of securing a Next.js SPA by adding SSL certificates, implementing SSO using Microsoft Azure, adding security headers and encrypting data stored in the browser's local storage. You created a demo website using Next.js and MUI components to contains the following features:
- SSL certificates
- Sign in users using a popup or redirect
- Request a user's profile information
- Lock access to page using `PermissionGate`
- Sign users out using a popup or redirect
- HTTP security headers
- Secure local storage

While we only scratched the surface of what you can do to enhance web security, we hope that this learning module provided you with the basic knowledge needed to secure your SPA and authenticate users. 

We recommend the following resources if you want to learn more about Microsoft Azure and its libraries, Next.js and Material UI:

- [Azure Single-page Application (SPA) Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/index-spa)
- [The Official Next.js Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- [The Official MUI Documentation](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/)
- [react-secure-storage Documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-secure-storage)
