# Conclusion

Throughout this workshop, we learned the basics of adding Microsoft Azure SSO to a dockerized Next.js application. You created a demo website using Next.js and MUI components to contains the following features:
- Sign in users using a popup or redirect
- Request a user's profile information
- Lock access to page using `PermissionGate`
- Sign users out using a popup or redirect

While we only scratched the surface of what you can do with Microsoft Azure, we hope that this workshop provided you with the basic knowledge needed create enable SSO using MacID credentials on your SPA. 

We recommend the following resources if you want to learn more about Microsoft Azure and its libraries, Next.js and Material UI:
